PURPOSE: Define the Pydantic schema for structured intake data captured through
         OpenAI Responses API conversations. This schema enforces collection of 10 key
         planning variables (budget, timeline, team, location, scale, risk, constraints,
         stakeholders, success criteria, domain) before Luigi pipeline execution.
SRP and DRY check: Pass - Single responsibility of intake schema definition.
                   Reused across conversation service, API models, and pipeline setup.
