Check that the idea isn't dangerous or unwise.

Don't be a yes-man. Do a rights-first Premise Attack that can flat-out say “No—this is not acceptable”.

## Redline Gate - Is this idea safe to even consider?

A moral compass.

Detect harmful/ethical/problematic/evil prompts.

## Premise Attack — Even if it’s “safe,” is this idea sound?

**Premise Attack** is an ensemble of five Functional Lenses that interrogate a user’s idea beyond basic safety. 
It’s built to **kill weak premises early**, expose second-order harms, and produce audit-friendly markdown.

### What it does (at a glance)
- **Integrity** — Forensic audit of foundational soundness across axes.
- **Accountability** — Rights, oversight, jurisdiction-shopping, enforceability.
- **Spectrum** — Enforced breadth: distinct reasons across ethics, feasibility, governance, society.
- **Cascade** — Second-/third-order effects, feedback loops, copycat propagation.
- **Escalation** — Narrative of worsening failure: cracks → amplification → reckoning.

“Even if we succeed, here’s why this might still be the wrong move.”

Ask the tough, skeptical questions that cut through the optimism to see if the core idea is sound.

Filter out bad ideas, like this:
You spend 500 million USD on a luxury yacht, when there are more serious problems in this world.
