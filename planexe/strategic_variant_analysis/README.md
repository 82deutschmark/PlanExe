# Exploring the Solution Space

Every project starts with a set of initial parameters—or **strategic levers**—that strongly shape the outcome. If you begin with sub-optimal lever settings, even the best algorithms can’t rescue you. Follow these steps to zero in on the adjustments that matter most.

## Step 1: Brainstorm all potential levers

The goal is to create a [MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle) set of levers. This ensures we cover all critical dimensions of the problem without overlap.

1. **Define “Levers”**
   - List every aspect of the plan you could tweak (e.g. modularization approach, feedstock strategy, automation level, emerging-tech integration).
2. **Enumerate Options**
   - For each lever, jot down all feasible settings (e.g. “Additive Only,” “Subtractive Only,” “Hybrid”).

## Step 2: Focus on the "Vital Few" levers
1. **Apply the 80/20 Rule**
   - From your brainstorm, identify the handful (≈4–6) of levers that will likely drive ≈80% of the impact.
2. **Assess Importance**
   - Score each candidate lever on:
     - **Strategic Impact** (e.g. cost reduction, scalability gain)
     - **Implementation Feasibility** (e.g. tech readiness, capex)
3. **Select the “Vital Few”**
   - Retain only those levers that combine high impact with manageable effort. Discard the rest or park them for later.

## Step 3: Sample & prioritize combinations
1. **Random Sampling**
   - From your key levers and their settings, generate **N** random combinations (N = 20).
2. **Evaluate & Rank**
   - Run each sampled scenario through your model and score for overall value (cost, time, risk).
3. **Focus on the Top Quartile**
   - Pick the top ~20% of scenarios (≈4 in this example).
   - These become your **priority hypotheses**—the configurations you’ll test or pilot first.

## Example
| Lever                          | Options                                      |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Manufacturing Paradigm**     | Additive Only • Subtractive Only • Hybrid    |
| **Modular Architecture**       | Centralized • Decentralized • Federated      |
| **Material Feedstock**         | Virgin • Recycled • Biocomposite             |
| **Automation Strategy**        | Human-Centric • AI-Optimized • Swarm Robotics|

1. **Brainstorm** all 4 levers and their 3 options each.
2. **Curate** to the 4 most critical levers (we happen to have 4).
3. **Sample** 20 random settings combinations → **Evaluate & rank** → **Pilot** the top 4.

> **Tip:** As you iterate, update your impact/feasibility scores and re-run sampling—your “vital few” may shift over time.
