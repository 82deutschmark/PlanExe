Establish a 5-year, $250 million program in Delhi to address critical water scarcity and pollution by developing a modular manufacturing hub for Advanced Water Purification (AWP) plants. Designed specifically to recycle municipal wastewater into potable water, the AWP system will directly mitigate Yamuna River contamination and reduce dependency on severely depleted groundwater aquifers. This initiative will deliver a scalable, mass-production-ready model, positioning Delhi as a global exporter of standardized 'water-positive' solutions to similarly stressed urban regions worldwide.
