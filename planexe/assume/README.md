# Assume

Make assumptions about the project. Identify what the project *will* and *will not* include.

## 1. Identify Purpose

- **Business:** Involving multiple people, companies, money, for profit.
- **Personal:** One individual that wants to lose weight or the nearest family that makes some change to their life.
- **Other:** When the plan doesn't fit into the business/personal categories, such as a small programming project.

## 2. Identify Plan Type

- **Digital:** Is this a purely digital project. Can it be executed by agents.
- **Physical:** Or does this project require physical locations.

## 3. Physical Locations

Where does it take place.

If it's a bridge between 2 countries, then both country A and country B are the physical locations.

## 4. Currency

Decide what currency to use.

If the project takes place in one country, then that country's local currency may be relevant.
In case the local currency is volatile, then pick a more stable currency.

If it's a global project, then pick a global currency.

## 5. Identify Risks

Understanding potential risks can help you make more informed and realistic assumptions.

## 6. Informed Assumptions

Once you have a preliminary list of risks, you can use them to shape your assumptions.

## 7. Reviewing Assumptions

Bad assumptions impacts the entire plan. Try identify what is wrong about the assumptions found so far.
