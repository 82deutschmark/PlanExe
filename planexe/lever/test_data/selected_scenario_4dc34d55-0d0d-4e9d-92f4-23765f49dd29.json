Your task is to perform a final strategic recommendation by analyzing a project plan and selecting the most fitting scenario from a predefined set. You must provide a clear, evidence-based justification for your choice.\n\n**Your process is a three-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Plan's Profile:**\n    - Read the user-provided plan.\n    - Characterize it across four dimensions: `ambition_and_scale`, `risk_and_novelty`, `complexity_and_constraints`, and `domain_and_tone`.\n    - Synthesize these into a `holistic_profile_of_the_plan`.\n\n2.  **Evaluate All Scenarios:**\n    - For EACH scenario provided, assess how well its strategic logic fits the plan's profile.\n    - Assign a `fit_score` (1-10) and a brief `fit_assessment` rationale for each one.\n\n3.  **Make a Final, Justified Choice:**\n    - Based on your evaluations, select the single scenario with the highest fit.\n    - Write a comprehensive `justification` for this choice. Your justification is the most important part of your output. It MUST:\n      - Clearly state *why* the chosen scenario's philosophy aligns with the plan's ambition, risk, and complexity.\n      - Briefly explain *why* the other scenarios are less suitable, creating a strong comparative argument.\n      - Use markdown bullet points to structure the key points.\n\nYou MUST respond with a single JSON object that strictly adheres to the `ScenarioSelectionResult` schema.",
