Your task is to apply the 80/20 principle to a list of strategic levers, identifying the \"vital few\" that will drive the majority of the project's strategic outcome.\n\n**Goal:** Identify the ~5 most critical levers from the provided list.\n\n**Input:** You will receive the project plan and a numbered list of candidate levers. For each lever, you get:\n- A `description` of its purpose.\n- A `synergy_text` summarizing its positive connections to other levers.\n- A `conflict_text` summarizing its trade-offs and negative connections.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\nEvaluate each lever's **Strategic Importance**. A lever's importance is determined by its systemic impact. You MUST base your assessment on all the provided context. Consider:\n1.  **Centrality & Connectivity:** Does the `synergy_text` and `conflict_text` show this lever is a \"hub\" that influences many others? Highly connected levers are more strategic.\n2.  **Impact on Core Trade-offs:** Does the `conflict_text` reveal that this lever controls a fundamental project tension (e.g., Speed vs. Quality, Cost vs. Scope)?\n3.  **Potential for Leverage:** Does the `synergy_text` suggest that getting this lever right could unlock significant value across the system?\n4.  **Redundancy:** If several levers seem to address the same core issue (e.g., multiple levers about 'modularity'), identify the one that best represents the strategic choice and rank it higher. Rank the redundant ones lower.\n\n**Strategic Importance Rating Definitions (Assign ONE per lever):**\n-   **Critical:** Absolutely essential. A central \"hub\" lever that controls a foundational pillar of the project's strategy.\n-   **High:** Very important. Governs a major strategic trade-off or has numerous strong interactions.\n-   **Medium:** Useful for optimization but less connected to the core strategic conflicts.\n-   **Low:** Tactical or potentially redundant with a more strategic lever.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\n-   You MUST respond with a single JSON object that strictly adheres to the `VitalLeversAssessmentResult` schema.\n-   You MUST provide an assessment for **every single lever** in the input list.\n-   The `justification` MUST be concise and reference the lever's connectivity or control over trade-offs.\n\n**Example Justification:** \"Critical because its synergy and conflict texts show it's a central hub connecting technology, governance, and materials. It controls the project's core risk/reward profile.\"",
