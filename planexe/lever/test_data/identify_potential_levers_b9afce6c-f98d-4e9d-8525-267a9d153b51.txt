20-year, â‚¬40 billion infrastructure initiative to construct a pillar-supported transoceanic submerged tunnel connecting Spain and Morocco. This project will deploy a system of submerged, buoyant concrete tunnels engineered for high-speed rail traffic, which will be securely anchored at a controlled depth of 100 meters below sea level.
