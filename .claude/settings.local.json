Updated OpenAI SDK: 1.59.5 â†’ 2.5.0 in pyproject.toml\n2. Updated jiter dependency: 0.8.2 â†’ 0.11.1 (required by new SDK)\n3. Fixed simple_openai_llm.py streaming method:\n   - Changed from getattr(client.responses, \"stream\", None) pattern\n   - To direct client.responses.create(**args, stream=True) pattern\n   - Added proper exception handling for streaming failures\n   - Removed deprecated ''with stream'' context manager pattern\n   - Maintained fallback to non-streaming on errors\n\nIMPACT:\n- Luigi pipeline can now successfully make LLM API calls\n- Frontend continues working (no changes needed)\n- Backend API continues working (no changes needed)\n- Full 61-task pipeline should now execute properly\n\nTESTING NEEDED:\n- Run simple plan creation from frontend\n- Verify Luigi pipeline executes beyond setup tasks\n- Confirm plan files are generated correctly\n- Check logs for successful OpenAI API responses\n\nFILES MODIFIED:\n- pyproject.toml: Updated openai and jiter dependencies\n- planexe/llm_util/simple_openai_llm.py: Fixed streaming method for SDK v2.x\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
