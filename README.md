## What is PlanExe?

PlanExe is a planning AI. You input a vague description of what you want and PlanExe outputs a plan. [See generated plans here](https://neoneye.github.io/PlanExe-web/use-cases/).

# Installation

Clone this repo, then install and activate a virtual environment. Finally, install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neoneye/PlanExe.git
cd PlanExe
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Configuration

**Config A:** Run a model in the cloud using a paid provider. Follow the instructions in [OpenRouter](extra/openrouter.md).

**Config B:** Run models locally on a high-end computer. Follow the instructions for either [Ollama](extra/ollama.md) or [LM Studio](extra/lm_studio.md).

Recommendation: I recommend **Config A** as it offers the most straightforward path to getting PlanExe working reliably.

# Usage

PlanExe comes with a Gradio-based web interface. To start the local web server:

```bash
(venv) python -m src.plan.app_text2plan
```

This command launches a server at http://localhost:7860. Open that link in your browser, type a vague idea or description, and PlanExe will produce a detailed plan.

To stop the server at any time, press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.
