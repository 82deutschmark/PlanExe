# Future plan for PlanExe

## Execute the plan

Currently it's up to humans to execute a plan. How can this be automated?

Ideally take an entire plan and go with it.


## Improve plan

**Multiple refinements:** Currently PlanExe generates the first iteration of the plan.
Usually issues arises when making the first iteration, that have to be incorporated into the timeline.
In the future I want to do multiple iterations, until the plan is of a reasonable quality.

**Validate the plan with deep research:** Currently there is no validation.
It's up to humans to be skeptic about the plan, does this make sense, check everything.
There may be issues with: assumptions, numbers, flaws.
