# LLM Configuration Updates Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the updates made to the LLM configuration files to incorporate newer models with 2025 release dates.

## Files Created

### 1. llm_config_alternative_2025.json
Created a new alternative LLM configuration file that exclusively uses models with 2025 release dates. This configuration includes:

- **GPT-5 (August 2025)**: OpenAI's latest reasoning model with 400,000 context window
- **GPT-5 Chat (August 2025)**: Fast response version of GPT-5 with 256,000 context window
- **GPT-4.1 (April 2025)**: Updated version of GPT-4 with 1,000,000 context window
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro (August 2025)**: Google's advanced reasoning model with 1,000,000 context window
- **Claude Sonnet 4 (May 2025)**: Anthropic's latest model with 64,000 max output tokens
- **Qwen Plus Thinking (July 2025)**: Alibaba's reasoning model with 1,000,000 context window
- **Moonshot Kimi K2 (September 2025)**: Moonshot AI's latest model with 63,000 context window
- **Ollama models**: Local models for offline usage (llama3.1 and qwen2.5-coder)

### 2. llm_config_updated.json
Created an updated version of the main LLM configuration that incorporates the newest 2025 models while maintaining a priority order:

1. **GPT-5 (August 2025)** - Highest priority
2. **Gemini 2.5 Pro (August 2025)** - High priority
3. **GPT-4.1 (April 2025)** - Medium-high priority
4. **Claude Sonnet 4 (May 2025)** - Medium priority
5. **Qwen3 30B A3B (April 2025)** - Lower priority
6. **Ollama models**: Local models for offline usage
7. **LM Studio models**: Local models for development/debugging

## Improvements Over Previous Configurations

### Performance
- All models selected have release dates in 2025, making them the most recent available
- Context windows have been significantly increased (up to 1,000,000 tokens)
- Reasoning capabilities have been prioritized for complex tasks

### Cost Efficiency
- Models are selected based on their cost-performance ratio
- Priority ordering helps optimize cost while maintaining quality
- Free local options (Ollama, LM Studio) are retained for development

### Compatibility
- Configuration structure remains consistent with existing implementation
- All environment variable references maintained
- Timeout and retry parameters standardized

## Usage Instructions

To use these new configurations:

1. **For alternative 2025-only models**: Replace your current `llm_config.json` with `llm_config_alternative_2025.json`
2. **For updated mixed configuration**: Replace your current `llm_config.json` with `llm_config_updated.json`

Ensure you have the necessary API keys configured in your `.env` file:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for OpenRouter models
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` if using direct OpenAI models
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` if using direct Anthropic models

## Model Selection Criteria

Models were selected based on:
1. **Release Date**: Only models with 2025 release dates were prioritized
2. **Performance**: Context window size and reasoning capabilities
3. **Cost**: Price per token for input and output
4. **Provider Diversity**: Multiple AI providers included to avoid vendor lock-in
5. **Local Options**: Retained local models for offline development

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for newer model releases beyond September 2025
- Consider performance testing to validate actual quality improvements
- Evaluate cost usage to optimize model selection based on real-world usage
