"""
Provides a system for generating initial time estimates for hierarchical tasks.

This module defines a `Node` class to represent tasks in a tree-like plan.
The core functionality lies in the `Node.resolve_duration()` method, which
recursively traverses the task tree to distribute and calculate time durations
based on a set of predefined hierarchical rules.

Key behaviors of the duration resolution process:
- **Child Resolution First:** Children's durations are resolved recursively
  before the parent's duration is finalized.
- **Rounding:** All calculated durations (for both parents and children)
  are rounded *up* to the nearest whole number (integer `Decimal`) during
  the `resolve_duration` process. This ensures compatibility with systems
  requiring integer durations (like Gantt charts) and prevents fractional values.
- **Initial None Handling:** Tasks initially set to `None` duration, which
  end up as leaves (no children or children resolve to 0), will finalize at `Decimal(0)`.
  After rounding, this remains `Decimal(0)`. `apply_minimum_duration` will
  then turn this into `Decimal(1)`.
- **Bottom-Up Summation:** If a parent task's duration was initially `None`,
  its resolved duration becomes the sum of its children's *resolved and rounded*
  durations. The parent's final duration is also rounded.
- **Top-Down Distribution (if parent > sum of children):**
    - If a parent has a specified duration (`!= None`) and its *rounded* value
      is greater than the sum of its children's *resolved and rounded* durations:
        - If *all* children originally had a specified duration (none were `None`),
          the parent's total *rounded* duration is distributed *evenly* among
          all children. The result of this division is *rounded up* before
          assigning to children, overwriting their initial/resolved values.
          The parent's duration becomes the sum of these newly assigned *rounded*
          child durations.
        - If *some* children originally had `None` duration, the excess duration
          (`rounded parent duration - sum of already resolved & rounded children durations`)
          is distributed among *only* those children that were originally `None`.
          The distributed amount per child is *rounded up* before assignment.
          Children with initial specified durations keep their resolved and rounded
          values unless the override rule above applied (which it wouldn't in this case).
          The parent's duration becomes the sum of all final *rounded* child durations.
- **Top-Down Constraint (if parent <= sum of children):**
    - If a parent has a specified duration (`!= None`) and its *rounded* value is
      less than or equal to the sum of its children's *resolved and rounded*
      durations, children initially set to `None` will receive `Decimal(0)` duration
      (which is rounded to `Decimal(0)`). Children with initial specified durations
      keep their resolved and rounded values. The parent's final duration will be
      the sum of its children's resolved and rounded durations (which will be
      >= the original rounded parent duration).
- **Preventing Negatives:** Initial durations must be non-negative or `None`.
  Calculated durations during distribution are clamped at `Decimal(0)` *before* rounding.
- **Final Consistency:** The parent's duration is *always* set to the final
  sum of its children's durations *after* the children have been resolved,
  rounded, and any distribution/assignment logic for them has occurred. This
  final parent duration is also rounded. All durations are guaranteed to be
  `Decimal` instances representing whole numbers (integers >= 0) after
  `resolve_duration`.

All durations are handled internally using Python's `Decimal` type for precision
during calculation, but rounded to integers for final storage.
The `Node` class also provides a `to_dict()` method for serializing the task tree,
which converts the integer `Decimal` durations to integer types.

The primary purpose of this module is to serve as an initial estimator,
providing a complete set of baseline durations for all tasks in a plan before
potentially more refined estimation techniques (e.g., human review, LLM-based
adjustments) are applied.
