# Review Assumptions
# Domain of the expert reviewer
Renewable Energy Project Finance and Risk Management

## Domain-specific considerations

- Energy market dynamics in Denmark and neighboring countries
- Grid connection costs and capacity constraints
- Long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) terms
- Technological advancements in solar panel efficiency and energy storage
- Political and regulatory landscape for renewable energy in Denmark

## Issue 1 - Incomplete Financial Model and Revenue Projections
The budget assumption lacks granularity. A detailed financial model is missing, including revenue projections based on realistic energy prices, PPA terms, and potential for ancillary services. Without this, the project's ROI and financial viability are uncertain. The plan does not address energy price volatility.

Recommendation:

- Develop a comprehensive financial model with detailed cost breakdowns and revenue projections based on various energy price scenarios and PPA terms.
- Conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of key variables on the project's ROI.
- Secure a PPA with a reputable off-taker to provide revenue certainty.

Sensitivity:

- A 10% decrease in energy prices could reduce the project's ROI by 8-12%.
- A 2% increase in interest rates could increase the total project cost by 3-5% and delay the ROI by 1-2 years.

## Issue 2 - Lack of Specificity Regarding Grid Connection and Capacity
The plan lacks specific details about the available grid capacity and associated costs for grid connection upgrades. Insufficient grid capacity or high connection costs could significantly impact the project's timeline and budget. The plan does not address the potential for curtailment.

Recommendation:

- Conduct a detailed grid impact study for each proposed location.
- Obtain firm cost estimates for grid connection.
- Negotiate grid connection agreements that address potential curtailment issues.
- Explore options for on-site energy storage.

Sensitivity:

- Required grid connection upgrades could increase the total project cost by 10-15% and delay the project completion date by 3-6 months.
- Curtailment occurring 5% of the time could reduce the project's annual revenue by 3-5%.

## Issue 3 - Insufficient Consideration of Long-Term Operational Costs and Panel Degradation
The plan lacks a detailed assessment of long-term operational costs and does not explicitly address the impact of panel degradation on energy output and revenue.

Recommendation:

- Develop a detailed O&M budget with realistic estimates for all operational costs.
- Incorporate panel degradation rates into the financial model.
- Consider investing in higher-quality panels with lower degradation rates.

Sensitivity:

- A 0.2% increase in the annual panel degradation rate could reduce the project's cumulative energy output by 5-7% over 25 years and decrease the ROI by 3-5%.
- A 20% increase in annual O&M costs could reduce the project's ROI by 2-3%.

## Review conclusion
The solar farm project has potential but requires a more detailed plan addressing gaps in financial modeling, grid connection, and long-term operational costs. By conducting thorough assessments, securing firm commitments, and implementing robust risk management strategies, the project can maximize its ROI.
