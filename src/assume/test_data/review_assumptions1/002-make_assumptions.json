    "question": "What are the funding and budget requirements for establishing the solar farm?",
    "assumptions": "Assumption: The initial investment includes land acquisition, installation of solar panels, infrastructure (roads, fencing), and permits. Based on industry standards in Denmark, this could range from \u20ac2-4 million, including contingency.",
    "assessments": "Title: Financial Feasibility Assessment\nDescription: Evaluation of the financial viability considering initial costs and potential returns.\nDetails: The estimated cost is \u20ac3 million. Expected return on investment (ROI) is 5-7 years with current technology advances and government incentives. Risks include fluctuating energy prices and regulatory changes. Mitigation strategies involve securing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and diversifying renewable energy portfolio."
