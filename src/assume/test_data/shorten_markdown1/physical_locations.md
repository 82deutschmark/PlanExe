This plan implies one or more physical locations.

## Requirements for physical locations

- High solar irradiance
- Flat land
- Proximity to grid connection
- Minimal environmental impact
- Suitable zoning and permits

## Location 1
Denmark

West Jutland

Near Varde

**Rationale**: West Jutland offers large open areas with relatively high solar irradiance compared to other parts of Denmark. The area near Varde has existing grid infrastructure and relatively flat terrain, making it suitable for a solar farm.

## Location 2
Denmark

South Jutland

Near Tønder

**Rationale**: South Jutland also has favorable conditions for solar energy production. The area near Tønder has available land and is close to existing high-voltage power lines, which can reduce connection costs.

## Location 3
Denmark

Zealand

Near Holbæk

**Rationale**: Zealand, particularly the area near Holbæk, offers a balance of available land and proximity to major population centers, potentially reducing transmission losses and increasing the value of the generated electricity. It also benefits from good infrastructure.

## Location Summary
The suggested locations in West Jutland (near Varde), South Jutland (near Tønder), and Zealand (near Holbæk) are all suitable for establishing a solar farm in Denmark due to their high solar irradiance, availability of flat land, proximity to grid connections, and other favorable conditions.
