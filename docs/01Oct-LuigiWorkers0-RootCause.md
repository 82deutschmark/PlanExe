# Luigi Pipeline Hang Root Cause Analysis

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Issue:** Luigi tasks stuck in PENDING status forever
**Root Cause:** `workers=0` parameter in `luigi.build()`   THIS MEANS NO WORKERS SPAWN!!!!

## The Problem

When running a plan, all 61 Luigi tasks would be scheduled as PENDING but never execute:

```
Luigi: 2025-10-01 23:25:08 - luigi-interface - INFO - Informed scheduler that task FullPlanPipeline has status PENDING
Luigi: 2025-10-01 23:25:08 - luigi-interface - INFO - Informed scheduler that task ReportTask has status PENDING  
Luigi: 2025-10-01 23:25:08 - luigi-interface - INFO - Informed scheduler that task PremortemTask has status PENDING
... [infinite hang, no tasks ever execute]
```

## Root Cause

In `planexe/plan/run_plan_pipeline.py` line 4668, the Luigi build was configured with:

```python
self.luigi_build_return_value = luigi.build(
    [self.full_plan_pipeline_task],
    local_scheduler=True,
    workers=0,  # ‚ùå THIS IS THE BUG
    log_level='INFO',
    detailed_summary=True
)
```

**The issue:** `workers=0` literally means **"no workers"** in Luigi, not "synchronous execution".

With zero workers:
- Luigi scheduler starts and analyzes the task dependency graph ‚úÖ
- Tasks are scheduled as PENDING ‚úÖ  
- **BUT** there are no worker threads to actually execute the tasks ‚ùå
- Pipeline hangs forever waiting for workers that don't exist ‚ùå

## The Fix

Changed `workers=0` to `workers=1`:

```python
self.luigi_build_return_value = luigi.build(
    [self.full_plan_pipeline_task],
    local_scheduler=True,
    workers=1,  # ‚úÖ FIXED: One single worker executes tasks synchronously
    log_level='INFO',
    detailed_summary=True
)
```

**Why `workers=1` is correct:**
- Creates **one single worker thread**
- Worker executes tasks **synchronously** in dependency order
- Compatible with Railway subprocess environment
- Tasks actually get executed instead of hanging

## Previous Misunderstanding

The previous developer thought:
- `workers=0` = "synchronous execution" ‚ùå WRONG
- `workers=1` = "would spawn worker thread that fails in Railway" ‚ùå WRONG

**Reality:**
- `workers=0` = "no workers at all, nothing executes" ‚úÖ
- `workers=1` = "single worker, synchronous execution, works everywhere" ‚úÖ

## Verification

After the fix, Luigi should:
1. Schedule tasks as PENDING ‚úÖ
2. **Immediately start executing** the first task (StartTimeTask) ‚úÖ
3. Progress through dependency graph ‚úÖ
4. Complete all 61 tasks ‚úÖ

## Commit Message

```
fix: Change Luigi workers=0 to workers=1 to enable task execution

ROOT CAUSE: workers=0 means "no workers" not "synchronous".
Tasks were scheduled but never executed (infinite PENDING hang).

FIX: workers=1 creates single synchronous worker that actually
executes tasks in dependency order.
