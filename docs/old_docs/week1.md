# Week 1 NextJS Implementation Plan for PlanExe

/**
 * Author: Claude Code using Sonnet 4
 * Date: 2025-09-19
 * PURPOSE: Detailed Week 1 implementation plan for NextJS frontend that respects the complex Luigi pipeline architecture and existing data structures
 * SRP and DRY check: Pass - This document focuses solely on Week 1 planning and respects existing PlanExe architecture

## ðŸ“‹ **Critical Architecture Understanding**

After reading the 4000-line pipeline file, I now understand the true complexity:

### **Luigi Pipeline Architecture (DO NOT TOUCH)**
- **61+ Luigi Tasks** in complex dependency chains
- **File-based I/O pattern** with numbered outputs (FilenameEnum)
- **Multi-stage data flow** from initial prompt â†’ strategic decisions â†’ WBS â†’ reports
- **LLM orchestration** with fallback mechanisms and retry logic
- **Progress tracking** via file completion percentage
- **Complex data transformation** between raw JSON and markdown at each stage

### **Key Data Flow Stages**
1. **Setup Phase**: StartTimeTask, SetupTask (initial prompt)
2. **Analysis Phase**: RedlineGate, PremiseAttack, IdentifyPurpose, PlanType
3. **Strategic Phase**: Potential levers â†’ deduplication â†’ enrichment â†’ vital few â†’ scenarios â†’ selection
4. **Context Phase**: Physical locations, currency strategy, risk identification
5. **Assumptions Phase**: Make â†’ distill â†’ review â†’ consolidate
6. **Planning Phase**: Pre-project assessment, project plan, governance phases (1-6)
7. **Execution Phase**: Team finding/enrichment, SWOT, expert review, data collection
8. **Structure Phase**: WBS Level 1 â†’ Level 2 â†’ Level 3, dependencies, durations
9. **Output Phase**: Pitch, schedule generation, review, executive summary, Q&A, premortem
10. **Report Phase**: HTML report compilation from all components

### **Critical Files and Dependencies**
- Each task produces **numbered outputs** (001-1-start_time.json, 018-2-wbs_level1.json, etc.)
- Tasks have **complex dependency chains** via `requires()` method
- **Context accumulation** - later tasks read outputs from multiple earlier tasks
- **Progress calculation** based on expected vs actual file completion
- **Final report** aggregates 20+ different markdown/HTML sections
