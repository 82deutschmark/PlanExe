Excellent question. Based on the search results provided earlier, this is the absolute definition of **classic overengineering**.

The authors' revised plan demonstrates skillful technical execution of a fundamentally flawed premise. It's **architecturally impressive but philosophically misguided**. You are attempting to solve a problem that may not exist with a solution that is maximally complex.

Here is a brutal fact-check against the principles from the search results:

### 🚩 The Overengineering Red Flags (As Per Your Sources)

1.  **"Using overly complex architectures (e.g., microservices for a small app)."** - [medium.com](https://medium.com/@sonali.nogja.08/the-overengineering-trap-why-simplicity-matters-in-software-development-3ad366feb227)
    *   **Your Case:** You are building a multi-agent, multi-server, distributed system coordinated by a workflow engine **for a planning document generator**. This is the architectural equivalent of using a rocket to toast bread. [dev.to](https://dev.to/hotfixhero/the-overengineers-handbook-how-to-build-a-rocket-to-toast-bread-ac7)

2.  **"'Reusable' code that isn't actually reused... hardly worth the time reusing."** - [quora.com](https://www.quora.com/At-what-point-do-you-think-code-is-over-engineered)
    *   **Your Case:** You are building a elaborate, general-purpose MCP framework for a specific, fixed set of 61 tasks. This framework's reusability for other projects is questionable and likely not worth the immense upfront cost.

3.  **"Building for situations that never arise... just in case."** - [medium.com](https://medium.com/womenintechnology/how-to-avoid-over-engineering-in-software-development-b85d1517846e)
    *   **Your Case:** The entire MCP infrastructure—the servers, the coordinator, the validation airlock—is a "just in case" architecture. It's designed for a future of limitless agentic flexibility that your current problem (`61 tasks`) does not require.

### 🔍 The Root Problem: Under-Understanding

The most insightful search result argues that ["overengineering isn't real"](https://hazelweakly.me/blog/overengineering-isn-t-real/), and is instead a symptom of **"under-understanding the problem."**

This is the crux of the issue. You have skipped the foundational step of questioning **what is the simplest thing that could possibly work?**

### ✅ A Ground-Up, Simplicity-First Approach (The Anti-Overengineered Plan)

**Step 1: Ruthlessly Question the Premise.**
Before writing a line of code, answer this: **What is the core, repetitive, "value-add" work an LLM could do that a simple function cannot?**
Is it:
*   Drafting unstructured text from a template? (e.g., `write_risk_assessment(project_description)`)
*   Structuring data from a vague prompt? (e.g., `suggest_wbs_tasks(project_goal)`)

**Forget agents, MCP, and Luigi for now.** The simplest version of this is a **single Python function that calls `client.chat.completions.create()`** with a good prompt.

**Step 2: Build a Single "Magic" Function.**
Choose the **one most valuable** task from your 61 (e.g., "Generate WBS L1/L2"). Build:
```python
# pseudo-code
def generate_wbs(project_description: str) -> dict:
    """Calls LLM to generate a WBS JSON structure."""
    prompt = f"""
    You are a project planning expert. Generate a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) as JSON for:
    {project_description}
    """
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(...)
    return validate_wbs_json(response.json()) # <- Your crucial validation layer
```
**This is your entire "agent."** No MCP. No server. Just a function.

**Step 3: Integrate It into Luigi.**
Your Luigi task becomes simple and deterministic:
```python
class GenerateWbsTask(luigi.Task):
    project_id = luigi.Parameter()

    def output(self):
        return luigi.LocalTarget(f"outputs/{self.project_id}/wbs.json")

    def run(self):
        project_desc = self._load_project_description() # from somewhere
        wbs_data = generate_wbs(project_desc) # Calls your LLM function
        with self.output().open('w') as f:
            json.dump(wbs_data, f)
```
**This preserves Luigi's retries, atomic outputs, and simplicity.**

**Step 4: Iterate and ONLY Add Complexity When Pain Demands It.**
*   **Pain:** "We have 10 of these LLM functions and prompt management is messy."
    *   **Solution:** Create a `prompts/` directory of template files. This is simpler than a full MCP Prompts server.
*   **Pain:** "We need web search for some tasks."
    *   **Solution:** Call a dedicated search API (e.g., SerpAPI) directly from the function that needs it. Avoid bringing in a full MCP `fetch` server.
*   **Pain:** "We are constantly changing prompts and need to avoid redeploying."
    *   **Solution:** *Now* consider a simple MCP server that just serves prompts. You've proven the need.

### 📊 Triage Your 61 Tasks

Not all tasks are created equal. Classify them:
1.  **Deterministic Tasks:** (e.g., `export_gantt_csv`). Keep them as pure Python/Luigi tasks. **Do not touch these.**
2.  **LLM-Augmented Tasks:** (e.g., `generate_wbs`, `write_exec_summary`). Implement as simple LLM-calling functions within Luigi tasks.
3.  **"Maybe Agentic" Tasks:** (e.g., tasks requiring multi-step web research). **Defer these.** They are the most complex and least valuable to start with.

### Conclusion: Start Over, Simply

**Yes, this plan is overengineered.** You are building the sprawling, flexible infrastructure for a problem you haven't yet fully defined.

**Stop and build the simplest version first.** The fancy MCP-based architecture should be a **forced evolution** driven by concrete pain points from a working simple system, not a speculative starting point. The goal is to generate planning documents, not to build a perfect agentic framework.

The ground-up approach will get you to a valuable result **weeks or months faster** and will clearly show you if you even *need* the complexity you're currently planning for.
