# Run Plan Pipeline Documentation

## Update (2025-10-03)
- Database-first writes introduced in v0.3.0 remain mandatory: tasks must call `db_service.create_plan_content` before writing files.
- `ReportTask` now cooperates with the fallback assembler; ensure new tasks provide machine-readable output so the recovery path can use them.
- Fallback HTML generation lives in FastAPI (`GET /api/plans/{plan_id}/fallback-report`) and reads the artefacts emitted by these tasks.
- Progress streaming uses the same queue signals as before; review `docs/Thread-Safety-Analysis.md` before modifying queue access.
## Overview

The `run_plan_pipeline.py` file is the core component of the PlanExe system that orchestrates the entire planning process. It defines a comprehensive pipeline using the Luigi task framework to generate detailed project plans from initial prompts.

## Key Components

### PlanTask Base Class

The `PlanTask` class is the foundation for all pipeline tasks. It extends `luigi.Task` and provides:

- **run_id_dir**: Path to the current run directory
- **speedvsdetail**: Controls the level of detail in processing (ALL_DETAILS_BUT_SLOW or FAST_BUT_SKIP_DETAILS)
- **llm_models**: List of LLM models to try in order of priority
- **LLMExecutor**: Handles LLM interactions with fallback mechanisms
- **Pipeline stopping mechanism**: Graceful handling of user interruptions

### Pipeline Tasks

The pipeline consists of multiple sequential and parallel tasks:

1. **Initial Analysis Tasks**
   - RedlineGateTask: Checks for sensitive content
   - PremiseAttackTask: Validates plan assumptions
   - IdentifyPurposeTask: Determines plan type (business/personal/other)
   - PlanTypeTask: Identifies if plan requires physical locations

2. **Strategic Planning Tasks**
   - PotentialLeversTask: Identifies adjustable factors
   - DeduplicateLeversTask: Removes redundant levers
   - EnrichLeversTask: Adds details to levers
   - FocusOnVitalFewLeversTask: Applies 80/20 principle
   - StrategicDecisionsMarkdownTask: Creates human-readable lever documentation

3. **Scenario Planning Tasks**
   - CandidateScenariosTask: Generates scenario combinations
   - SelectScenarioTask: Chooses the best scenario
   - ScenariosMarkdownTask: Documents scenarios

4. **Contextual Analysis Tasks**

- Multiple output formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML, CSV)
- Comprehensive error handling

## Potential Pitfalls for Developers

### 1. LLM Dependency Issues

**Problem**: The pipeline heavily depends on LLM responses. If models are not properly configured or are unavailable, tasks will fail.

**Solution**: 
- Ensure `llm_config.json` is properly configured
- Test with multiple model providers
- Implement proper error handling in custom tasks
- Monitor LLM response quality and adjust prompts as needed

### 2. Task Dependency Complexity

**Problem**: The pipeline has complex task dependencies that can be difficult to understand and modify.

**Solution**:
- Use the Luigi visualization tools to understand dependencies
- Make incremental changes to task dependencies
- Test thoroughly after any dependency changes
- Document any custom task additions

### 3. Performance Considerations

**Problem**: The pipeline can be very slow with `ALL_DETAILS_BUT_SLOW` setting due to many LLM calls.

**Solution**:
- Use `FAST_BUT_SKIP_DETAILS` during development
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Monitor execution time for each task
- Consider parallelizing independent tasks

### 4. File System Dependencies

**Problem**: The pipeline expects specific files in the run directory structure.

**Solution**:
- Ensure `START_TIME` and `INITIAL_PLAN` files exist before pipeline start
- Follow the established file naming conventions
- Handle file I/O errors gracefully
- Clean up temporary files appropriately

### 5. Memory Usage

**Problem**: Large JSON objects and multiple LLM contexts can consume significant memory.

**Solution**:
- Monitor memory usage during execution
- Process large data in chunks when possible
- Release unused resources promptly
- Consider using generators for large datasets

### 6. Error Recovery

**Problem**: When a task fails, it can be difficult to determine the root cause.

**Solution**:
- Implement detailed logging in custom tasks
- Use the `TRACK_ACTIVITY_JSONL` file for debugging
- Check the `log.txt` file in the run directory
- Implement proper exception handling with meaningful messages

### 7. Resume Functionality

**Problem**: Resuming an interrupted pipeline can be tricky.

**Solution**:
- Remove the `999-pipeline_complete.txt` file to resume a completed run
- Ensure all required input files are still present
- Check Luigi's built-in resume capabilities
- Monitor for partial/incomplete output files

### 8. Custom Task Development

**Problem**: Adding new tasks to the pipeline requires understanding of the existing structure.

**Solution**:
- Follow the existing task patterns
- Properly define task dependencies
- Implement both `run_with_llm` and `run_inner` methods as appropriate
- Add appropriate output file definitions
- Test new tasks in isolation before integrating

## Best Practices

1. **Task Implementation**:
   - Extend `PlanTask` for all new tasks
   - Implement appropriate `requires()` method
   - Define clear output files
   - Handle both success and failure cases

2. **LLM Interaction**:
   - Use the provided `LLMExecutor` for resilience
   - Format prompts clearly with context
   - Handle LLM response parsing carefully
   - Implement timeouts for LLM calls

3. **File Management**:
   - Use the `FilenameEnum` for consistent naming
   - Handle file I/O errors gracefully
   - Clean up temporary files
   - Validate file contents before processing

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Implement callback methods for long-running tasks
   - Provide meaningful progress messages
   - Update progress percentage accurately

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Catch specific exceptions when possible
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors with appropriate detail
   - Implement recovery mechanisms where possible

## Debugging Tips

1. Check the `log.txt` file in the run directory for detailed logs
2. Use Luigi's visualization tools to understand task dependencies
3. Monitor the `TRACK_ACTIVITY_JSONL` file for LLM interactions
4. Verify all required input files are present
5. Check LLM model configurations in `llm_config.json`
6. Use development mode (`FAST_BUT_SKIP_DETAILS`) for faster iteration

## Extending the Pipeline

To add new functionality to the pipeline:

1. Create a new task class extending `PlanTask`
2. Implement the required methods (`requires`, `output`, `run_with_llm` or `run_inner`)
3. Add the task to the `FullPlanPipeline.requires()` method
4. Update the `ReportTask` to include any new output in the final report
5. Test thoroughly with both speed settings

## Configuration

Key environment variables:
- `RUN_ID_DIR`: Path to the current run directory
- `SPEED_VS_DETAIL`: Processing speed setting
- `LLM_MODEL`: Primary LLM model to use

Ensure these are properly set before running the pipeline.


### Additional notes:

## ðŸ“‹ **Critical Architecture Understanding**

After reading the 4000-line pipeline file, I now understand the true complexity:

### **Luigi Pipeline Architecture (DO NOT TOUCH)**
- **62 Luigi Tasks** in complex dependency chains
- **File-based I/O pattern** with numbered outputs (FilenameEnum)
- **Multi-stage data flow** from initial prompt â†’ strategic decisions â†’ WBS â†’ reports
- **LLM orchestration** with fallback mechanisms and retry logic
- **Progress tracking** via file completion percentage
- **Complex data transformation** between raw JSON and markdown at each stage

### **Key Data Flow Stages**
1. **Setup Phase**: StartTimeTask, SetupTask (initial prompt)
2. **Analysis Phase**: RedlineGate, PremiseAttack, IdentifyPurpose, PlanType
3. **Strategic Phase**: Potential levers â†’ deduplication â†’ enrichment â†’ vital few â†’ scenarios â†’ selection
4. **Context Phase**: Physical locations, currency strategy, risk identification
5. **Assumptions Phase**: Make â†’ distill â†’ review â†’ consolidate
6. **Planning Phase**: Pre-project assessment, project plan, governance phases (1-6)
7. **Execution Phase**: Team finding/enrichment, SWOT, expert review, data collection
8. **Structure Phase**: WBS Level 1 â†’ Level 2 â†’ Level 3, dependencies, durations
9. **Output Phase**: Pitch, schedule generation, review, executive summary, Q&A, premortem
10. **Report Phase**: HTML report compilation from all components

### **Critical Files and Dependencies**
- Each task produces **numbered outputs** (001-1-start_time.json, 018-2-wbs_level1.json, etc.)
- Tasks have **complex dependency chains** via `requires()` method
- **Context accumulation** - later tasks read outputs from multiple earlier tasks
- **Progress calculation** based on expected vs actual file completion
- **Final report** aggregates 20+ different markdown/HTML sections
