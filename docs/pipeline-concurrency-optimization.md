# Pipeline Concurrency Optimization Analysis

**Author:** Cascade  
**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**PURPOSE:** Comprehensive analysis of concurrency opportunities in the PlanExe Luigi pipeline to identify and prioritize optimization strategies for reducing execution time through parallel LLM API calls.  
**SRP and DRY check:** Pass - This analysis document consolidates all concurrency opportunities without duplicating existing pipeline logic.

## Executive Summary

The PlanExe pipeline contains **significant opportunities for performance improvement** through concurrent LLM API execution. Current implementation processes many LLM calls sequentially when they could be parallelized, resulting in unnecessary execution delays.

**Key Findings:**
- **5 major sequential bottlenecks** identified
- **Potential 30-50% reduction** in total pipeline execution time
- **Low-risk optimizations** available that preserve existing dependencies
- **Foundation work needed** to add async support to LLM executor

---

## 1. Current Sequential Bottlenecks

### 1.1 Document Drafting Tasks (HIGH IMPACT)

**Location:** `run_plan_pipeline.py:DraftDocumentsToFindTask`, `DraftDocumentsToCreateTask`

**Current Pattern:**
```python
for index, document in enumerate(documents_to_find):
    draft_document = llm_executor.run(execute_draft_document_to_find)
    # Sequential - each document waits for previous
```

**Impact:** 
- 5-10 documents processed sequentially
- Each call: 10-30 seconds
- **Total potential savings: 40-120 seconds**

**Parallelization Strategy:**
- Process all documents concurrently using `asyncio.gather`
- Same input data, independent operations
- No inter-document dependencies

### 1.2 Expert Criticism Tasks (HIGH IMPACT)

**Location:** `expert/expert_orchestrator.py`

**Current Pattern:**
```python
for expert_index, expert_dict in enumerate(expert_list_truncated):
    expert_criticism = llm_executor.run(execute_expert_criticism)
    # Sequential - each expert waits for previous
```

**Impact:**
- 2-3 experts processed sequentially
- Each call: 15-45 seconds
- **Total potential savings: 30-90 seconds**

**Parallelization Strategy:**
- Get criticism from all experts concurrently
- Independent expert analysis
- Results aggregated after all complete

### 1.3 Expert Discovery Tasks (MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Location:** `expert/expert_finder.py`

**Current Pattern:**
```python
result1 = llm_executor.run(execute_function1)  # Get first 4 experts
result2 = llm_executor.run(execute_function2)  # Get next 4 experts
# Sequential - second call waits for first
```

**Impact:**
- Two sequential LLM calls for expert discovery
- Each call: 20-40 seconds
- **Total potential savings: 20-40 seconds**

**Parallelization Strategy:**
- Could potentially request all 8 experts in one call
- Or make two calls concurrently if structure requires it

### 1.4 WBS Task Duration Estimation (MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Location:** `run_plan_pipeline.py:EstimateTaskDurationsTask`

**Current Pattern:**
```python
for index, task_ids_chunk in enumerate(task_ids_chunks, start=1):
    estimate_durations = llm_executor.run(execute_estimate_task_durations)
    # Sequential - each chunk waits for previous
```

**Impact:**
- Task chunks of 3 processed sequentially
- 5-10 chunks typical
- Each call: 10-25 seconds
- **Total potential savings: 40-200 seconds**

**Parallelization Strategy:**
- Process all task chunks concurrently
- Independent duration estimation
- Aggregate results after completion

### 1.5 WBS Level 3 Task Decomposition (MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Location:** `run_plan_pipeline.py:CreateWBSLevel3Task`

**Current Pattern:**
```python
for index, task in enumerate(tasks_without_subtasks):
    create_wbs_level3 = llm_executor.run(execute_create_wbs_level3)
    # Sequential - each task decomposition waits for previous
```

**Impact:**
- Individual tasks decomposed sequentially
- 10-20 tasks typical
- Each call: 8-20 seconds
- **Total potential savings: 70-380 seconds**

**Parallelization Strategy:**
- Decompose all tasks concurrently
- Independent task breakdown operations
- Reconstruct WBS tree after completion

## 2. Task Dependency Analysis

### 2.1 Governance Phase Tasks (Already Optimized)

**Finding:** Governance phases are **already optimally structured** for concurrency:

```
Phase1 → Phase2 → Phase3 → Phase4 → Phase5 → Phase6
  ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
```

**Dependencies:** Each phase depends on the previous phase, but **phases 4-6 could run concurrently**:

- **Phase4** depends on: Phase2 + Phase3
- **Phase5** depends on: Phase2 + Phase3  
- **Phase6** depends on: Phase2 + Phase3

**Opportunity:** Phases 4, 5, and 6 could execute in parallel after Phase2+3 complete.

### 2.2 Team Enrichment Tasks (Already Optimized)

**Finding:** Team enrichment tasks are **already optimally structured**:

```
FindTeam → EnrichContract → EnrichBackground → EnrichEnvironment → Review
```

**Dependencies:** Sequential chain required for progressive enrichment.

### 2.3 Document Tasks (Optimization Opportunity)

**Current:**
```
FilterDocsToFind → DraftDocsToFind (sequential)
FilterDocsToCreate → DraftDocsToCreate (sequential)
```

**Optimized:**
```
FilterDocsToFind → DraftDocsToFind (concurrent)
FilterDocsToCreate → DraftDocsToCreate (concurrent)
```

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Phase 1: Foundation (Low Risk)

**Add Async Support to LLMExecutor**
```python
class LLMExecutor:
    async def run_async(self, execute_function):
        # Async version of existing run method
        # Use existing async LLM methods (achat, acomplete)
        
    async def run_batch_async(self, execute_functions):
        # Run multiple functions concurrently
        tasks = [self.run_async(func) for func in execute_functions]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables all subsequent optimizations
- Minimal risk to existing functionality
- Reuses existing async LLM capabilities

### 3.2 Phase 2: High-Impact Quick Wins (Medium Risk)

**Document Drafting Concurrency**
```python
# Current: Sequential
for index, document in enumerate(documents_to_find):
    draft_document = llm_executor.run(execute_draft_document_to_find)

# Optimized: Concurrent
async def draft_documents_concurrently(documents):
    execute_functions = [
        lambda llm, doc=document: DraftDocumentToFind.execute(llm, doc)
        for document in documents
    ]
    return await llm_executor.run_batch_async(execute_functions)
```

**Expert Criticism Concurrency**
```python
# Current: Sequential
for expert_index, expert_dict in enumerate(expert_list_truncated):
    expert_criticism = llm_executor.run(execute_expert_criticism)

# Optimized: Concurrent
async def get_expert_criticism_concurrently(experts):
    execute_functions = [
        lambda llm, expert=expert: ExpertCriticism.execute(llm, expert)
        for expert in experts
    ]
    return await llm_executor.run_batch_async(execute_functions)
```

### 3.3 Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Medium Risk)

**WBS Concurrency**
```python
# Task Duration Estimation
async def estimate_durations_concurrently(task_chunks):
    execute_functions = [
        lambda llm, chunk=chunk: EstimateWBSTaskDurations.execute(llm, chunk)
        for chunk in task_chunks
    ]
    return await llm_executor.run_batch_async(execute_functions)

# Task Decomposition
async def decompose_tasks_concurrently(tasks):
    execute_functions = [
        lambda llm, task=task: CreateWBSLevel3.execute(llm, task)
        for task in tasks
    ]
    return await llm_executor.run_batch_async(execute_functions)
```

**Governance Phase Concurrency**
```python
# Phases 4, 5, 6 can run concurrently
async def run_governance_phases_concurrently(inputs):
    phase4_task = GovernancePhase4Task(inputs)
    phase5_task = GovernancePhase5Task(inputs)
    phase6_task = GovernancePhase6Task(inputs)
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        phase4_task.run_async(),
        phase5_task.run_async(),
        phase6_task.run_async()
    )
    return results
```
