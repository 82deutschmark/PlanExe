## ðŸ›  **Implementation Strategy**

### **Incremental Development Approach**
1. **Build piece by piece** - Don't try to create everything at once
2. **Test frequently** - Test each component with the actual Luigi pipeline
3. **Respect existing architecture** - Never modify the Luigi pipeline files
4. **Focus on functionality first** - Polish and styling come after core features work

### **Risk Mitigation**
1. **Luigi Integration Risk**: Test API routes with actual pipeline early and often
2. **File System Risk**: Validate FilenameEnum patterns match exactly what Luigi creates
3. **Performance Risk**: Monitor memory usage during long pipeline runs
4. **State Management Risk**: Test session persistence across browser restarts

### **Success Criteria for Each Phase**
- **Phase 1**: API routes successfully proxy to Python backend
- **Phase 2**: UI components render and capture user input correctly  
- **Phase 3**: Files can be browsed and downloaded, state persists
- **Phase 4**: Complete end-to-end Luigi pipeline execution works

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Examine existing API routes** in `planexe-frontend/src/app/api/` to understand what's already built
2. **Identify gaps** in the current API implementation
3. **Create missing TypeScript interfaces** for data structures
4. **Complete Phase 1A** by finishing the core API routes
5. **Test each API route** with the existing Python backend
