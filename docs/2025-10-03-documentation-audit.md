# 2025-10-03 Documentation Audit Summary

## Scope
- Reviewed every file under `docs/` for accuracy against v0.3.2 (fallback report) behaviour.
- Archived stale debugging logs and outdated plans into `docs/old_docs/`.
- Refreshed core reference material and the API README to reflect current stack health.

## Actions
- Moved legacy investigation logs (1 Oct and earlier), historical Railway triage notes, and MCP experiment docs into `docs/old_docs/`.
- Rewrote current-living docs: `docs/CODEBASE-INDEX.md`, `docs/HOW-THIS-ACTUALLY-WORKS.md`, `docs/RAILWAY-SETUP-GUIDE.md`, and SSE-related guides now include Oct 3 status.
- Annotated fallback report plans (`02OctCodexPlan*.md`) with delivery status and retained outstanding Phase 5 work.
- Updated `docs/run_plan_pipeline_documentation.md` with database-first/fallback reminders.
- Added this summary to document what changed during the audit.

## Follow-Ups
- Implement agent-driven remediation (Phase 5) when prioritised; documentation is ready to record it.
- Continue monitoring SSE/WebSocket reliability—update `docs/SSE-Reliability-Analysis.md` and `docs/Thread-Safety-Analysis.md` once fixes merge.
- Keep Railway guidance current with any future Dockerfile or environment shifts.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] `docs/` root now contains only current references and status-tracked guides.
- [x] Archived files confirmed under `docs/old_docs/` (including MCP/ directory).
- [x] `README_API.md` reflects fallback report endpoint, single-container Railway deploy, and v0.3.2 changes.
