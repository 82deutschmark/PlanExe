# GPT-5 Responses API Migration Progress — 18 Oct 2025

## Completed in this slice

- ✅ Promoted **gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07** to the primary slot with **gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07** as the explicit fallback in `llm_config.json`.
- ✅ Replaced the legacy Chat Completions shim with a **Responses API client** that enforces `reasoning.effort=high`, `reasoning.summary=detailed`, and `text.verbosity=high` for every call.
- ✅ Added a **schema registry** (`planexe/llm_util/schema_registry.py`) so each Luigi task’s Pydantic model is registered once and reused for the new `text.format.json_schema` payloads.
- ✅ Upgraded `StructuredSimpleOpenAILLM` to request structured streaming natively via the Responses API and to return reasoning/token metadata alongside the parsed model.
- ✅ Added regression tests for the schema registry to catch drift when new models are introduced.

## Follow-up actions for the next iteration

1. **Wire streaming deltas to the WebSocket layer.** Instrument Luigi output handlers to emit `LLM_STREAM` events now that the base client returns real-time chunks.
2. **Persist reasoning traces.** Capture `reasoning_tokens` and text deltas from `_last_response_payload` and store them in `LLMInteraction` once the executor is updated.
3. **Frontend rendering.** Teach the monitoring UI to display reasoning vs. final text using the upcoming WebSocket envelope.
4. **End-to-end smoke test.** Run the full pipeline against GPT-5 mini/nano to validate fallback behavior and collect token analytics.
