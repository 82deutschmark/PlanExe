# GPT-5 Responses API Migration Progress — 18 Oct 2025

## Completed in this slice

- ✅ Promoted **gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07** to the primary slot with **gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07** as the explicit fallback in `llm_config.json`.
- ✅ Replaced the legacy Chat Completions shim with a **Responses API client** that enforces `reasoning.effort=high`, `reasoning.summary=detailed`, and `text.verbosity=high` for every call.
- ✅ Added a **schema registry** (`planexe/llm_util/schema_registry.py`) so each Luigi task’s Pydantic model is registered once and reused for the new `text.format.json_schema` payloads.
- ✅ Upgraded `StructuredSimpleOpenAILLM` to request structured streaming natively via the Responses API and to return reasoning/token metadata alongside the parsed model.
- ✅ Added regression tests for the schema registry to catch drift when new models are introduced.
- ✅ Luigi stdout now emits `LLM_STREAM` envelopes through a shared context helper; the FastAPI WebSocket service recognizes those frames and rebroadcasts them without losing sequence metadata.
- ✅ `LLMInteraction` persistence auto-merges reasoning traces, deltas, and token counters from `_last_response_payload`, ensuring every task run stores audit-ready telemetry.
- ✅ The monitoring terminal renders a **Live LLM Streams** panel that separates reasoning from final text and surfaces token usage in real time so operators can verify fallbacks and effort settings.

## Follow-up actions for the next iteration

1. **End-to-end smoke test.** Run the full pipeline against GPT-5 mini/nano to validate fallback behavior and collect token analytics once sanitized API keys are available in the CI environment (currently blocked in container).
2. **Backfill telemetry.** Write a one-off migration that replays existing `llm_interactions` to populate reasoning/text delta metadata for legacy runs.

Refer to `docs/RESPONSES-API-OCT2025.md` and `docs/15OctPlanExeResponsesAPI.md` for the full architectural background.
