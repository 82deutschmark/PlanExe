# PURPOSE: Provide a standalone ResponseIDStore that retrieves the latest response IDs from
#          llm_interactions so conversation and analysis services can chain Responses API calls
#          without creating circular imports.
# SRP and DRY check: Pass â€” isolates response ID persistence logic already shared across
#          services, avoiding duplication and dependency cycles.
